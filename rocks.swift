// This gist demonstrates how to create a Rock, Paper, Scissors game in iOS using swift.
// The "GAME OF ROCK, SCISSORS, PAPER" was originally published in David Ahl's 
// "Basic Computer Games" back in 1978. "Basic Computer Games" was comprised of 101
// computer games written in the BASIC programming language and was often used
// by beginner programmers as a means of learning to code. Therefore, I've named
// my iOS app written in Swift "Rock, Scissors, Paper" instead of "Rock, Paper, Scissors"
// in honor of Ahl's book.
// Note that this is a simple single view app with one ViewController. The view contains 
// a few static labels which do not change, and three buttons: ROCK, SCISSORS, PAPER.
// When a user clicks on one of the buttons, the app will make its choice, and the outcome
// of the game will be displayed to the player by a dialog popup message.
